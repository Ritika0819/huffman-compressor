# huffman-compressor
Huffman code allows you to compress and decompress the text size on character level. 
This is done by changing the length of the character's bit sequences.
It can be done to reduce the cost of transmission.
Huffman coding is optimal because the Huffman tree gives us the codes that are unique and can hence it can be uniquely decodable code.
The most frequent character is assigned the smallest code and the least frequent character is assigned the largest code.
